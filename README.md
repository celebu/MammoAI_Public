# Mammo AI - An Artificial Intelligence System for Real-time Risk Assessment at Mammography Screening


## Introduction

At the moment, in the UK the majority of women go through the same breast cancer screening programme, but different women have different levels of risk of getting breast cancer. We look at how we can assess risk using mammograms to enable new breast cancer screening programmes that they are more suited to the level of risk faced by each woman. In particular we focus on the sub-problems: 

1. **Detection:** risk of cancer at screening (now and visible),
2. **Masking:** risk of getting a false negative (now and not visible), 
3. **Risk assesment:** future cancer after a negative screen.

This is a CRUK funded project (reference 49757/A28689).
